# Schedule-Assistance-UF
Small project I decided to work on that will show professor ratings when in course search

How to Use As of Now:
Currently it will go to schedule page and list professors you currently have
All you have to do is:
1. Create your own .env file
2. Put your username and password in it(MAKE SURE that you only keep this on your computer so it is secure)
3. Hit confirm on duo authenticator on your phone

That is all for now.
